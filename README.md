# Overview of analysis
===
> In this analysis we are Trying to figure out the viability of a surfing themed ice cream shop in Oahu. For this particular project we will be looking into the island precipitation of the months of June and December. 

# Results:
===
- There is a higher max temperature for the month of June than December. However, with only a difference of 2 degrees.

- In the module, we can see that the average rain fall is light.

- June should see more customers on average due to the higher average and minimum temperature

# Summary:
===

> Through analyzing the spread of weather for this data, we can say that while December is colder it is still possible to run a business focussed on outdoor activities even in colder month of December. However, it would be better to consider other factors such as the average hours of sunshine per day as an example.
